# kasei-coin
The objective of this project is to establish a crowdsale for a newly minted ERC-20 token named KaseiCoin. The contract for KaseiCoin is being developed in Remix, while Ganache is utilized to test it on a blockchain. To purchase tokens and sign transactions, the team will be utilizing the MetaMask wallet.

Initially, the team will create a MetaMask test network, following which they will import two accounts via private keys from Ganache to allow them to interact with the test network. Upon completion of this process, the MetaMask wallet will display a balance of 100 ETH by default, and should look similar to the image below:

The next task is to test the contracts. You can see below the KaseiCoin contract has been compiled successfully.
